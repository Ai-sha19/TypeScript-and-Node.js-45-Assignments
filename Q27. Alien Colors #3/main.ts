// • If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.

// • If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.

// • Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the appropriate color alien.


// First version in which alien is green

let alienColor1: string = "green";

if (alienColor1 === "green") {
    console.log("The player earned 5 points")
} else if (alienColor1 === "yellow") {
    console.log("The player earned 10 points")
} else if (alienColor1 === "red") {
    console.log("The player earned 15 points")
}

// Second version in which alien is yellow

let alienColor2 = "yellow";

if (alienColor2 === "green") {
    console.log("The player earned 5 points")
} else if (alienColor2 === "yellow") {
    console.log("The player earned 10 points")
} else if (alienColor2 === "red") {
    console.log("The player earned 15 points")
}

// Third version in which alien is red

let alienColor3 = "red";

if (alienColor3 === "green") {
    console.log("The player earned 5 points")
} else if (alienColor3 === "yellow") {
    console.log("The player earned 10 points")
} else if (alienColor3 === "red") {
    console.log("The player earned 15 points")
