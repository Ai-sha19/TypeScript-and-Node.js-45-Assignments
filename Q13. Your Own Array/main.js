// Assignment # 13. Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
// List of favorite mode of transportation
let transportation = ['motorcycle', 'Car', 'Train', 'Cycle'];
// Printing statements about each mode of transportation by for loop
for (let i = 0; i < transportation.length; i++) {
    console.log('I would like to own a ' + transportation[i]);
}
export {};
